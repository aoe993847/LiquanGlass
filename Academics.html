                    <p class="text paragraph_a">
                        The University joined Oracle Academy in 2005 as the first institution in Taiwan to become a member. In 2019, the College of Management COM took full advantage of its Institutional membership benefits by adopting Oracle Cloud Tier through the Oracle Academy Cloud Program.
                        Thus, enabling teachers and students to harness their skills and get hands-on experience with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Since then the college has advanced and offered students with the Oracle Database 12c Administrator certificate exam, emphasizing the full set of concepts and skills that Database Administrators DBAs need for cloud computing.
                        Recognizing Oracle Academy as the de facto curriculum for database administration and programming, the COM has created what it calls the ‘Oracle School,’ a cross-departmental concept embracing the learning resources associated with Oracle technologies. It serves not only as an umbrella for Oracle instruction but also as an intermediary for preparing teachers of the highest quality.
                        The Oracle School is part of the Artificial Intelligence Center, AI+ Center, which integrates Oracle Academy database management and Cloud courses with Big Data, Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning with AI teaching and institutional research. In addition, the school offers courses in other Oracle applications, including Primavera Project Management, etc.
                        The course curricula is centered on object-oriented programming (Java), database, and emerging technologies including artificial intelligence and machine learning, big data, and more. It is also well-supported by the programs such as Education Bytes, Oracle Academy Application Express, Workshops in a Box, etc.
                        Oracle Academy Education Bytes is a modular learning resource that includes hands-on labs, projects and challenges, and videos and presentations. Students can use many of these as self-directed learning. Oracle Academy Application Express (APEX) workspace is utilized by educators and students to work in the Oracle Database Cloud, plus technical support.
                        Notably the partnership between the University and the Oracle Academy has been recognized, awarded, and financially supported by the Taiwanese Ministry of Science and the Ministry of Education, which has blessed it with accolades for fostering information technology talent. The collaboration has been praised for its Higher Education Sprout Project, designed to encourage faculty to apply effective strategies to maximize student learning and nurture talent.
                        Furthermore, the college keeps abreast of new Oracle technologies through online training in Oracle Academy curriculum and maintains close contact with Oracle’s offices in Taiwan. Experts regularly visit the campus to conduct seminars. Moreover, Oracle volunteers visit the Oracle School to discuss with students the types of roles available in IT, talk about their own career paths, and provide mentoring and coaching. 
                        Since the inception of the program, more than 3,000 students at the university have taken Oracle database management courses. Of these, 1,000 have acquired Oracle certification proficiency.

                        The Interactive Learning and Innovative Center (ILIC) has been established by the COM to foster the quality and efficiency of education through implementing new educational models and technologies. Student-centered pedagogy, which combines interactive learning, Team-based Learning (TBL), and Problem -based Learning (PBL), is implemented and encouraged in this center.
                        Different from traditional lecturing methods, this new teaching space engages students to actively participate in discussions and absorb management knowledge from theory and practical issues via online and offline learning.
                        A smart classroom is adopted in order to incorporate active learning in this center. Learners can interact with the teacher and collaborate with their peers instantly via the instant response system. The smart lecture capture system is implemented to record lectures automatically via multiple cameras so that lectures can be saved in the database. The lecture capture system is integrated with a cloud management system;
                        therefore, students can review the video clips after each class to ensure the effectiveness of learning via the i-Learning system. In addition, the cloud learning platform maintains records of each participant, so that instructors can analyze the results and provide personalized feedback and support.
                        The establishment of ILIC enables teachers to adopt novel teaching approaches and enhances the interaction between teachers and students. In addition, innovative practices in management education research projects are also conducted.
